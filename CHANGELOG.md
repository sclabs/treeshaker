## 0.0.3 - 2020-05-16

### Added
 - A license (MIT).

### Fixed
 - A case where imports would sometimes be rewritten incorrectly, see [#4](https://github.com/sclabs/treeshaker/issues/4).

## 0.0.2 - 2020-03-22

### Added
 - New feature: list files in the format `package.name/relative/path.ext` in a
   new `package_data` target configuration key to find the file (relative to the
   named package) and copy it to the `<outdir>`.
 - New feature: include `add_setup_py=True` in any `[target:XXX]` section to
   produce a pip-installable Python package complete with an auto-generated
   `setup.py`.

### Fixed
 - Post-build commands now run in series (i.e., the second command won't be run
   until the first completes).
